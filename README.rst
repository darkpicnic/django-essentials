Django Essentials
================================================

After building several projects, I finally made a script to do most of the work. This file currently does this:

* creates a skeleton fabfile.py
* creates a .gitignore file with these already added:
	* venv-projectname
	* .DS_Store
	* *.pyc
	* *.db
